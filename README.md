# Homework Assignment 14

![Assignment 14](https://github.com/PGE323M/assignment14/workflows/.github/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

## Instructions

If you didn't realize it, the [CMG Tutorial on 1D single-phase flow](https://youtu.be/jt5euIPuB6Y) was also the exact problem we wrote our own Python code for in [Assignment 11](https://github.com/PGE323M/assignment11/blob/master/assignment11.ipynb).  With some easy modifications, we can also solve [Assignment 13](https://github.com/PGE323M/assignment13) in CMG.  Recall the problem schematic

The easiest way to work this problem in CMG is to work through the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/jt5euIPuB6Y) saving your input file as `assignment14.dat`.  Then edit the input file in a text editor and manually change the lines related to grid spacing and permeability.  The permeability line should look something like

```
PERMI  20000 10 100 50 20
```

In this case, 20000 is the largest permeability value allowed in the "fake" grid block without causing an error in CMG.  Edit the line related to grid spacing (keyword: `DI IVAR`) in an appropriate way as well.  Save the input file and run.  Remember to run the simulation for 3 days in 1 day increment time steps.  Once the program has finished running without error, there should be a file `assignment14.out` in the run directory.  Copy this file into this repository, add, commit, and push to Github for submission.

You can use CMG from home via the by remote connection into CPE LRC computers.  Go to [https://pge.utexas.edu/LRC](https://pge.utexas.edu/LRC) to download a remote connection file.  

There are some small differences between the 2023 version of CMG and the one used in the video, but they should not affect your ability to follow the video and complete the assignment.  The most notable change is that the main menus for Reservoir, Components, Wells, etc. is located on the file menu at the top of the Builder window.

## Testing

If you would like to check to see if your solution is correct, run the following commands at the Terminal command line 

```bash
python test.py
```
a status message of `OK` indicates you have the correct solution.
